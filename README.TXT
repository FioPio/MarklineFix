# Disclaimer

This is a modified version of the [obsidian-markline](https://github.com/hotoo/obsidian-markline) plugin created by [hotoo](https://github.com/hotoo).

I made these modifications because the original plugin did not work on Android, which I needed. Additionally, it now uses the year ranges of the provided events instead of using the current year.

This repository is provided with no warranty of functionality, and I am not responsible for any harm that may result from its use.

# Installation

1. Go to your Obsidian vault directory.
2. Enter the `.obsidian` folder.
3. Enter the `plugins` folder.
4. (a) If there is a folder named `markline`:
   - Enter it.
   - Replace the existing `main.js` file with the one provided in this repository.
4. (b) If there is no `markline` folder:
   - Create the folder yourself and enter it.
   - Paste the files `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` into this folder.

5. Finally, activate the plugin by going to Settings -> Community Plugins, searching for `markline` at the bottom of the page, and enabling it.

Hope this is useful for you!


P.S.: I also add the source code just in case somebody wants my modifications to make some changes as well.
